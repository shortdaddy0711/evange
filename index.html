                In the beginning, God created the universe and everything in it.
                God made human beings in His own image so we can know Him, love
                Him and worship Him. He wants to give you eternal life in heaven
                and abundant life on earth. He is a good king and He is love!

              <h3>THIS DARKNESS REPRESENTS SIN.</h3>
              <p>
                We live in sin. God made us to worship Him alone. But we served
                other gods and raised ourselves That is sin. Sin separates us
                from God. That's why our hearts are filled with darkness - like
                greed, selfishness, pride and hatred. God hates sin, because He
                is righteous. One day we will all die and stand before God and
                be punished for our sins. We are all destined to go to hell
                forever!
